# My Music App ðŸŽµðŸ“±

This repository contains the source code for My Music App, a music streaming application built using Kotlin, Clean Architecture, Hilt, Retrofi, and Jetpack Compose. The application utilizes Media 3 for media playback, Notifications for media control, and an interactive UI.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Clean Architecture**: The application follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and testability.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Media 3**: Media playback is managed using the Media 3 library, ensuring efficient use of system resources and a seamless user experience.
- **Notifications**: Media controls are accessible from system notifications, allowing users to control playback even when the app is in the background.
- **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. It is used in this project to provide dependencies to the various classes and functions, making the code more testable and reusable.
- **Retrofit**:The project uses Retrofit for networking calls.
